<!-- Overview -->
## Overview

Everybody needs a good laugh from time to time. That's where GoodLaughs can help.

Here's why:
* GoodLaughs is a way for users to share, create, and review laughs
* A laugh can be as simple as a knock-knock joke or a long and humorous story
* Users can save their laughs forever with a LaughBox - create your own and put laughs into it so you'll never forget where a specific laugh is

In the future, we want our users to be able to use GoodLaughs as a social media platform. The ability to search laughs, have a custom profile, and add friends are all features we would have liked to implement.
